            <h1>What is the relationship between AstraEditor and TurboWarp/other editors?</h1>
            <h5>The content is based on personal opinions</h5>
        </div>
        <main>
            <h2>Overall Relationship</h2>
            <p>In summary, TurboWarp is a deeply modified (forked) version of Scratch. Other derivative editors, including
                AstraEditor, are in turn modified from TurboWarp.</p>
            <p>Because TurboWarp is open-source, these derivative projects do not constitute "plagiarism" of one another.</p>
            
            <h2>Plugins & Extensions</h2>
            <p>Most of these editors maintain their own repositories for extensions and plugins. It is also common for them to
                integrate extension libraries from other editors.</p>
            <p>Typically, plugins are added upon submission by their developers. <strong>I am not fully certain of the specific
                    open-source licensing terms governing all plugins</strong>, so I will not go into detail here. The key point is
                this: there is no need to be surprised if you see the same plugin or extension available in different editors—this
                is a normal part of the ecosystem.</p>
            
            <h2>China</h2>
            <p>The Scratch-based coding scene in China is relatively niche. Currently, the main editors with significant presence in
                China are: Scratch, TurboWarp, and CodeMao.</p>
            <p>CodeMao is a heavily customized fork of Scratch (details beyond that are not relevant here). Our focus remains on
                TurboWarp.</p>
            
            <h3>TurboWarp and Its Derivatives in China</h3>
            <p>The most notable TurboWarp-based editors in the region are Gandi and 02Engine. Gandi is tailored for the CCW
                community, while 02Engine is developed by 02Studio. Neither is affiliated with AstraEditor.</p>
            <p>In practice, you will often find the same extensions or plugins across different editors. This can happen either by
                the choice of the extension developer or by the editor developer's initiative to include it. Unless stated
                otherwise, this does not imply unauthorized use or "theft."</p>
            
            <h4>AstraEditor's Position</h4>
            <p>To be clear, AstraEditor itself is one such derivative of TurboWarp. It exists alongside other forks like 02Engine
                and PenguinMod.</p>
